Applied CSS styles to create a visually appealing layout for the landing page.
Ensured mobile-first design and implemented media queries for responsive adaptation.

4. **Interaction Enhancement**
Incorporated JavaScript to introduce interactive features, enhancing user engagement.

🚧 **Challenges**
Deciding on the optimal branching strategy for version control.
Making design decisions, such as switching from layout grid to flexbox for better design flexibility.
Merging and version control practices within GitHub.
Balancing Figma usage for design mockups with project development.

🎓 **Lessons Learned**
Finding the right balance between workflow best practices and personal comfort level for version control.
Flexibility in design decisions based on project needs and user experience.
Paying attention to merging strategies and version control details.
Prioritizing a robust prototype in Figma to minimize uncertainties during development.

🏃‍♂️ **Sprint 3: Sanity Studio Integration and Image Processing**
🎯 **Goals**
- **Sanity Studio Setup:** Initialize and set up Sanity Studio for content management.
- **Content Display:** Fetch content from Sanity and seamlessly display it on the website.
- **Image Transformation Integration:** Integrate the Midjourney bot for image transformation features.
- **Design & Responsiveness:** Enhance design elements to ensure cross-device and cross-browser compatibility.

🚀 **Progress**
This sprint focused on integrating the transformed athlete images and establishing a solid connection with Sanity for content management.

1. **Midjourney Image Processing**
   - Delved into the Midjourney Discord bot, understanding its features.
   - Successfully transformed athlete images into captivating art styles.

2. **Sanity Integration**
   - Designed and implemented schemas in Sanity tailored to the project's needs.
   - Managed to fetch and display the transformed images and athlete biographies on the website.

🚧 **Challenges**
Creating schemas in Sanity was a bit challenging, especially deciding their logical order. I faced a setback when I lost data from some schemas after renaming them, which consumed valuable time. Retrieving data for the athlete bio page was also tougher than expected.

🎓 **Lessons Learned**
- Proper time allocation is essential, especially when dealing with database integrations and manual data inputs.
- Before jumping into schema creation, it's crucial to have a clear plan about their logical sequence to avoid complications.
