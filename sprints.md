Sprint 1 Goals Response:

1.	Introduction

This was the first of a total 4 sprints, and the first sprint is all about getting started with the prototype using Figma. After the design mockup was completed, I started with setting up the project structure and creating the initial repository, this took about a week or so.

2. Work Completed

During this sprint I had two main goals in mind. Firstly, I created the mockup design in Figma, and secondly, I set up the project folder structure.

• Created the wireframes for the landing page layout, including the header, banner, gallery and latest transformation section.

• Defined the CSS variables for fonts, colors and spaces to ensure consistent styling throughout the website.

• Implemented the HTML structure for the landing page components based on the wireframes.

3. Challenges Faced

I faced quite a few challenges with the Figma design during this sprint. Since I didn't have prior experience with Figma, creating a prototype was more time-consuming and difficult than I expected. I spent a lot of valuable time trying to figure out how it works, and it's clear to me that I have room to grow in this area. The one-day introduction was not sufficient for grasping the complexity of the software, leading to struggles and delays in the design process. This experience has motivated me to work on improving my skills with Figma in the future.

4. Lessons Learned

• I learned just how important it is to have enough time and the right tools when you're learning something new, like Figma in this case.

• I also found out that seeking help from other sources and peers can make a big difference, especially when official training falls short.

• Despite the challenges I faced with Figma, they've only motivated me to improve. I know I have some growing to do in this area, and I'm committed to working on it for the future sprints.
